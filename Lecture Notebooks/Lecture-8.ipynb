The whole Christmas season!\\nNow, please don\\'t ask why. No one quite knows the reason.\\nIt could be his head wasn\\'t screwed on just right.\\nIt could be, perhaps, that his shoes were too tight.\\nBut I think that the most likely reason of all,\\nMay have been that his heart was two sizes too small.\\n\\nWhatever the reason,\\nHis heart or his shoes,\\nHe stood there on Christmas Eve, hating the Whos,\\nStaring down from his cave with a sour, Grinchy frown,\\nAt the warm lighted windows below in their town.\\nFor he knew every Who down in Whoville beneath,\\nWas busy now, hanging a mistletoe wreath.\\n\\n\"And they\\'re hanging their stockings!\" he snarled with a sneer,\\n\"Tomorrow is Christmas! It\\'s practically here!\"\\nThen he growled, with his Grinch fingers nervously drumming,\\n\"I MUST find some way to stop Christmas from coming!\"\\nFor Tomorrow, he knew, all the Who girls and boys,\\nWould wake bright and early. They\\'d rush for their toys!\\nAnd then! Oh, the noise! Oh, the Noise!\\nNoise! Noise! Noise!\\nThat\\'s one thing he hated! The NOISE!\\nNOISE! NOISE! NOISE!\\n\\nThen the Whos, young and old, would sit down to a feast.\\nAnd they\\'d feast! And they\\'d feast! And they\\'d FEAST!\\nFEAST! FEAST! FEAST!\\nThey would feast on Who-pudding, and rare Who-roast beast.\\nWhich was something the Grinch couldn\\'t stand in the least!\\n\\nAnd THEN They\\'d do something He liked least of all!\\nEvery Who down in Whoville, the tall and the small,\\nWould stand close together, with Christmas bells ringing.\\nThey\\'d stand hand-in-hand. And the Whos would start singing!\\nThey\\'d sing! And they\\'d sing! And they\\'d SING!\\nSING! SING! SING!\\n\\nAnd the more the Grinch thought of this Who-Christmas-Sing,\\nThe more the Grinch thought, \"I must stop this whole thing!\"\\n\"Why, for fifty-three years I\\'ve put up with it now!\"\\n\"I MUST stop this Christmas from coming! But HOW?\"\\n\\nThen he got an idea! An awful idea!\\nTHE GRINCH GOT A WONDERFUL, AWFUL IDEA!\\n\\n\"I know just what to do!\" The Grinch laughed in his throat.\\nAnd he made a quick Santy Claus hat and a coat.\\nAnd he chuckled, and clucked, \"What a great Grinchy trick!\"\\n\"With this coat and this hat, I look just like Saint Nick!\"\\n\\n\"All I need is a reindeer...\"\\nThe Grinch looked around.\\nBut, since reindeer are scarce, there was none to be found.\\nDid that stop the old Grinch?\\nNo! The Grinch simply said,\\n\"If I can\\'t find a reindeer, I\\'ll make one instead!\"\\nSo he called his dog, Max. Then he took some red thread,\\nAnd he tied a big horn on the top of his head.\\n\\nTHEN\\nHe loaded some bags\\nAnd some old empty sacks,\\nOn a ramshackle sleigh\\nAnd he hitched up old Max.\\n\\nThen the Grinch said, \"Giddap!\"\\nAnd the sleigh started down,\\nToward the homes where the Whos\\nLay asnooze in their town.\\n\\nAll their windows were dark. Quiet snow filled the air.\\nAll the Whos were all dreaming sweet dreams without care.\\nWhen he came to the first little house on the square.\\n\"This is stop number one,\" the old Grinchy Claus hissed,\\nAnd he climbed to the roof, empty bags in his fist.\\n\\nThen he slid down the chimney. A rather tight pinch.\\nBut, if Santa could do it, then so could the Grinch.\\nHe got stuck only once, for a moment or two.\\nThen he stuck his head out of the fireplace flue.\\nWhere the little Who stockings all hung in a row.\\n\"These stockings,\" he grinned, \"are the first things to go!\"\\n\\nThen he slithered and slunk, with a smile most unpleasant,\\nAround the whole room, and he took every present!\\nPop guns! And bicycles! Roller skates! Drums!\\nCheckerboards! Tricycles! Popcorn! And plums!\\nAnd he stuffed them in bags. Then the Grinch, very nimbly,\\nStuffed all the bags, one by one, up the chimney!\\n\\nThen he slunk to the icebox. He took the Whos\\' feast!\\nHe took the Who-pudding! He took the roast beast!\\nHe cleaned out that icebox as quick as a flash.\\nWhy, that Grinch even took their last can of Who-hash!\\n\\nThen he stuffed all the food up the chimney with glee.\\n\"And NOW!\" grinned the Grinch, \"I will stuff up the tree!\"\\n\\nAnd the Grinch grabbed the tree, and he started to shove,\\nWhen he heard a small sound like the coo of a dove.\\nHe turned around fast, and he saw a small Who!\\nLittle Cindy-Lou Who, who was not more than two.\\n\\nThe Grinch had been caught by this tiny Who daughter,\\nWho\\'d got out of bed for a cup of cold water.\\nShe stared at the Grinch and said, \"Santy Claus, why,\\n\"Why are you taking our Christmas tree? WHY?\"\\n\\nBut, you know, that old Grinch was so smart and so slick,\\nHe thought up a lie, and he thought it up quick!\\n\"Why, my sweet little tot,\" the fake Santy Claus lied,\\n\"There\\'s a light on this tree that won\\'t light on one side.\"\\n\"So I\\'m taking it home to my workshop, my dear.\"\\n\"I\\'ll fix it up there. Then I\\'ll bring it back here.\"\\n\\nAnd his fib fooled the child. Then he patted her head,\\nAnd he got her a drink and he sent her to bed.\\nAnd when Cindy-Lou Who went to bed with her cup,\\nHE went to the chimney and stuffed the tree up!\\n\\nThen the last thing he took\\nWas the log for their fire!\\nThen he went up the chimney, himself, the old liar.\\nOn their walls he left nothing but hooks and some wire.\\n\\nAnd the one speck of food\\nThat he left in the house,\\nWas a crumb that was even too small for a mouse.\\n\\nThen\\nHe did the same thing To the other Whos\\' houses\\n\\nLeaving crumbs\\nMuch too small\\nFor the other Whos\\' mouses!\\n\\nIt was quarter past dawn...\\nAll the Whos, still a-bed,\\nAll the Whos, still asnooze\\nWhen he packed up his sled,\\nPacked it up with their presents! The ribbons! The wrappings!\\nThe tags! And the tinsel! The trimmings! The trappings!\\n\\nThree thousand feet up! Up the side of Mt. Crumpit,\\nHe rode with his load to the tiptop to dump it!\\n\"Pooh-pooh to the Whos!\" he was grinchishly humming.\\n\"They\\'re finding out now that no Christmas is coming!\"\\n\"They\\'re just waking up!

He looked towards the sound.\\n\"That\\'s funny,\" thought Horton. \"There\\'s no one around.\"\\nThen he heard it again! Just a very faint yelp\\nAs if some tiny person were calling for help.\\n\"I\\'ll help you,\" said Horton. \"But who are you? Where?\"\\nHe looked and he looked. He could see nothing there\\nBut a small speck of dust blowing past though the air.\\n\\n\"I say!\" murmured Horton. \"I\\'ve never heard tell\\nOf a small speck of dust that is able to yell.\\nSo you know what I think?...Why, I think that there must\\nBe someone on top of that small speck of dust!\\nSome sort of a creature of very small size,\\ntoo small to be seen by an elephant\\'s eyes...\\n\\n\"...some poor little person who\\'s shaking with fear\\nThat he\\'ll blow in the pool! He has no way to steer!\\nI\\'ll just have to save him. Because, after all,\\nA person\\'s a person, no matter how small.\"\\n\\nSo, gently, and using the greatest of care,\\nThe elephant stretched his great trunk through the air,\\nAnd he lifted the dust speck and carried it over\\nAnd placed it down, safe, on a very soft clover.\\n\\n\"Humpf!\" humpfed a voice. Twas a sour Kangaroo.\\nAnd the young kangaroo in he pouch said \"Humpf!\" too\\n\"Why, that speck is as small as the head of a pin.\\nA person on that?...why, there never has been!\"\\n\\n\"Believe me,\" said Horton. \"I tell you sincerely,\\nMy ears are quite keen and I heard him quite clearly.\\nI know there\\'s a person down there. And, what\\'s more,\\nQuite likely there\\'s two. Even three. Even four.\\nQuite likely...\\n\\n\"...a family, for all that we know!\\nA family with children just starting to grow.\\nSo, please,\" Horton said, \"as a favour to me,\\nTry not to disturb them. Just let them be.\"\\n\\n\"I think you\\'re a fool!\" laughed the sour kangaroo\\nAnd the young kangaroo in her pouch said, \"Me, too!\\nYou\\'re the biggest blame fool in the jungle of Nool!\"\\nAnd the kangaroos plunged in the cool of the pool.\\n\"What terrible splashing!\" the elephant frowned.\\n\"I can\\'t let my very small persons get drowned!\\nI\\'ve got to protect them. I\\'m bigger than they.\"\\nSo he plucked up the clover and hustled away.\\n\\nThrough the high jungle tree tops, the news quickly spread:\\n\"He talks to a dust speck! He\\'s out of his head!\\nJust look at him walk with that speck on the flower!\"\\nAnd Horton walked, worrying, almost an hour.\\n\"Should I put this speck down?...\" Horton though with alarm.\\n\"If I do, these small persons may come to great harm.\\nI can\\'t put it down. And I won\\'t! After all\\nA person\\'s a person. No matter how small.\"\\n\\nThen Horton stopped walking.\\nThe speck-voice was talking!\\nThe voice was so faint he could just barely hear it.\\n\"Speak up, please,\" Said Horton. He put his ear near it.\\n\"My friend,\" came the voice, \"you\\'re a very fine friend.\\nYou\\'ve helped all us folks on this dust speck no end.\\nYou\\'ve saved all our houses, our ceilings and floors.\\nYou\\'ve saved all our churches and grocery stores.\"\\n\\n\"You mean...\" Horton gasped, \"you have buildings there, too?\"\\n\"Oh, yes,\" piped the voice. \"We most certainly do...\\n\"I know,\" called the voice, \"I\\'m too small to be seen\\nBut I\\'m Mayor of a town that is friendly and clean.\\nOur buildings, to you, would seem terribly small\\nBut to us, who aren\\'t big, they are wonderfully tall.\\nMy town is called Who-ville, for I am a Who\\nAnd we Whos are all thankful and greatful to you\"\\n\\nAnd Horton called back to the Mayor of the town,\\n\"You\\'re safe now. Don\\'t worry. I won\\'t let you down.\"\\n\\nBut, Just as he spoke to the Mayor of the speck,\\nThree big jungle monkeys climbed up Horton\\'s neck!\\nThe Wickersham Brothers came shouting, \"What rot!\\nThis elephants talking to Whos who are not!\\nThere aren\\'t any Whos! And they don\\'t have a Mayor!\\nAnd we\\'re going to stop all this nonsense! So there!\"\\n\\nThey snatched Horton\\'s clover! They carried it off\\nTo a black-bottomed eagle named Valad Vlad-I-koff,\\nA mighty strong eagle, of very swift wing,\\nAnd they said, \"Will you kindly get rid of this thing?\"\\nAnd, before the poor elephant could even speak,\\nThat eagle flew off with the flower in his beak.\\n\\nAll that late afternoon and far into the night\\nThat black-bottomed bird flapped his wings in fast flight,\\nWhile Horton chased after, with groans, over stones\\nThat tattered his toenails and battered his bones,\\nAnd begged, \"Please don\\'t harm all my little folks, who\\nHave as much right to live as us bigger folk do!\"\\n\\nBut far, far beyond him, that eagle kept flapping\\nAnd over his shoulder called back, \"Quit your yapping.\\nI\\'ll fly the night through. I\\'m a bird. I don\\'t mind it.\\nAnd I\\'ll hide this, tomorrow, where you\\'ll never find it!\"\\n\\nAnd at 6:56 the next morning he did it.\\nIt sure was a terrible place that he hid it.\\nHe let that small clover drop somewhere inside\\nOf a great patch of clovers a hundred miles wide!\\n\"Find THAT!\" sneered the bird. \"But I think you will fail.\"\\nAnd he left\\nWith a flip\\nOf his black-bottomed tail.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll find it!\" cried Horton. \"I\\'ll find it or bust!\\nI SHALL find my friends on my small speck of dust!\"\\nAnd clover, by clover, by clover with care\\nHe picked up and searched the, and called, \"Are you there?\"\\nBut clover, by clover, by clover he found\\nThat the one that he sought for was just not around.\\nAnd by noon poor old Horton, more dead than alive,\\nHad picked, searched, and piled up, nine thousand and five.\\n\\nThen, on through the afternoon, hour after hour...\\nTill he found them at last! On the three millionth flower!\\n\"My friends!\" cried the elephant. \"Tell me! Do tell!\\nAre you safe? Are you sound? Are you whole? Are you well?\"\\n\\nFrom down on the speck came the voice of the Mayor:\\n\"We\\'ve really had trouble! Much more than our share.\\nWhen that black-bottomed birdie let go and we dropped,\\nWe landed so hard that our clocks have all stopped.\\nOur tea pots are broken. Our rocking-chairs are smashed.\\nAnd our bicycle tires all blew up when we crashed.\\nSo, Horton, Please!\" pleaded that voice of the Mayor\\'s,\\n\"Will you stick by us Whos while we\\'re making repairs?\"\\n\\n\"Of course,\" Horton answered. \"Of course I will stick.\\nI\\'ll stick by you small folks though thin and though thick!\"\\n\\n\"Humpf!\" humpfed a voice!\\n\"For almost two days you\\'ve run wild and insisted\\nOn chatting with persons who\\'ve never existed.\\nSuch carryings-on in our peaceable jungle!\\nWe\\'ve had quite enough of your bellowing bungle!\\nAnd I\\'m here to state,\" snapped the big kangaroo,\\n\"That your silly nonsensical game is all through!\"\\nAnd the young kangaroo in her pouch said, \"Me, too!\"\\n\\n\"With the help of the Wickersham Brothers and dozens\\nOf Wickersham Uncles and Wickershams Cousins\\nAnd Wickersham In-Laws, whose help I\\'ve engaged,\\nYou\\'re going to be roped! And you\\'re going to be caged!\\nAnd, as for your dust speck...hah!\\nThat we shall boil\\nIn a hot steaming kettle of Beezle-Nut Oil!\"\\n\"Boil it?...\" gasped Horton!\\n\"Oh, that you can\\'t do!\\nIt\\'s all full of persons!\\nThey\\'ll prove it to you!\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor!\" Horton called. \"Mr. Mayor!\\nYou\\'ve got to prove that you really are there!\\nSo call a big meeting. Get everyone out.\\nMake every Who holler! Make every Who shout!\\nMake every Who scream! If you don\\'t, every Who\\nIs going to end up in a Beezle-Nut stew!\"\\n\\nAnd, down on the dust speck, the scared little Mayor\\nQuick called a big meeting in Who-ville Town Square.\\nAnd his people cried loudly. They cried out in fear:\\n\"We are here! We are here! We are here!\"\\n\\nThe elephant smiled: \"That was clear as a bell.\\nYou Kangaroos surely heard that very well.\"\\n\"All I heard,\" snapped the big kangaroo, \"Was the breeze,\\nAnd the faint sound of wind through the far-distant trees.\\nI heard no small voices. And you didn\\'t either.\"\\nAnd the you kangaroo in her pouch said, \"Me, neither.\"\\n\\n\"Grab him!\" they shouted. \"And cage the big dope!\\nLasso his stomach with ten miles of rope!\\nTie the knots tight so he\\'ll never shake lose!\\nThen dunk that dumb speck in the Beezle-Nut juice!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHorton fought back with great vigor and vim\\nBut the Wickersham gang was too many for him.\\nThey beat him! They mauled him! They started to haul\\nHim into his cage! But he managed to call\\nTo the Mayor: \"Don\\'t give up! I believe in you all\\nA person\\'s a person, no matter how small!\\nAnd you very small persons will not have to die\\nIf you make yourselves heard! So come on, now, and TRY!\"\\n\\nThe Mayor grabbed a tom-tom. He started to smack it.\\nAnd, all over Who-ville, they whooped up a racked.\\nThey rattled tie kettles! They beat on brass pans,\\nOn garbage pail tops and old cranberry cans!\\nThey blew on bazooka and blasted great toots\\nOn clarinets, oom-pahs and boom-pahs and flutes!\\n\\nGreat gusts of loud racket rang high through the air.\\nThey rattled and shook the whole sky! And the Mayor\\nCalled up through the howling mad hullabaloo:\\n\"Hey Horton! Hows this? Is our sound coming through?\"\\n\\nAnd Horton called back, \"I can hear you just fine.\\nBut the kangaroos\\' ears aren\\'t as strong, quite, as mine.\\nThey don\\'t hear a thing! Are you sure all you boys\\nAre doing their best? Are they ALL making noise?\\nAre you sure every Who down in Who-ville is working?\\nQuick! Look through your town! Is there anyone shirking?\"\\n\\nThrough the town rushed the Mayor, From the east to the west.\\nBut everyone seemed to be doing his best.\\nEveryone seemed to be yapping or yipping!\\nEveryone seemed to be beeping or bipping!\\nBut it wasn\\'t enough, all this ruckus and roar!\\nHe HAD to find someone to help him make more.\\nHe raced through each building! He searched floor-to-floor!\\n\\nAnd, just as he felt he was getting nowhere,\\nAnd almost about to give up in despair,\\nHe suddenly burst through a door and that Mayor\\nDiscovered one shirker! Quite hidden away\\nIn the Fairfax Apartments (Apartment 12-J)\\nA very small, very small shirker named Jo-Jo\\nwas standing, just standing, and bouncing a Yo-Yo!\\nNot making a sound! Not a yipp! Not a chirp!\\nAnd the Mayor rushed inside and he grabbed the young twerp!\\n\\nAnd he climbed with the lad up the Eiffelberg Tower.\\n\"This,\" cried the Mayor, \"is your towns darkest hour!\\nThe time for all Whos who have blood that is red\\nTo come to the aid of their country!\" he said.\\n\"We\\'ve GOT to make noises in greater amounts!\\nSo, open your mouth, lad! For every voice counts!\"\\n\\nThus he spoke as he climbed. When they got to the top,\\nThe lad cleared his throat and he shouted out, \"YOPP!\"\\n\\nAnd that Yopp...\\nThat one small, extra Yopp put it over!\\nFinally, at last! From that speck on that clover\\nTheir voices were heard! They rang out clear and clean.\\nAnd the elephant smiled. \"Do you see what I mean?...\\nThey\\'ve proved they ARE persons, no matter how small.\\nAnd their whole world was saved by the smallest of All!\"\\n\\n\"How true! Yes, how true,\" said the big kangaroo.\\n\"And, from now on, you know what I\\'m planning to do?...\\nFrom now on, I\\'m going to protect them with you!\"\\nAnd the young kangaroo in her pouch said...\\n\"...ME, TOO!\"\\n\"From the sun in the summer. From rain when it\\'s fall-ish,\\nI\\'m going to protect them. No matter how small-ish!\"\\n',\n",
